properties:
  os-tuning.tcp_keepalive_time:
    description: The interval between the last data packet sent and the first keepalive probe (seconds).
    example: 120
  os-tuning.tcp_keepalive_interval:
    description: The interval between subsequential keepalive probes, regardless of what the connection has exchanged in the meantime (seconds).
    example: 30
  os-tuning.tcp_keepalive_probes:
    description: The number of unacknowledged probes to send before considering the connection dead and notifying the application layer.
    example: 8

  os-tuning.vm_dirty_ratio:
    description: "Percentage of the RAM which can be left unwritten to disk. MUST be much more than your write rate, which is usually one FS block size (4KB) per metric."
    example: 80
  os-tuning.vm_dirty_background_ratio:
    description: "Percentage of the RAM when background writer have to kick in and start writes to disk. Make it way above the value you see in '/proc/meminfo|grep Dirty' so that it does not interfere with dirty_expire_centisecs"
    example: 50
  os-tuning.vm_dirty_expire_centisecs:
    description: "Allow pages to be left dirty no longer than these centiseconds. If unwritten page stays longer than time set here, kernel starts writing it out. Default 10 minutes"
    example: 60000

    description: "Determines the time that must elapse before TCP/IP can release a closed connection and reuse its resources"
    default: 5
  os-tuning.tcp_tw_recycle:
    description: "It enables fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets. The default value is 0 (disabled)"
    default: 0
  os-tuning.tcp_tw_reuse:
    description: "Allows reusing sockets in TIME_WAIT state for new connections when it is safe from protocol viewpoint. The default value is 0 (disabled)"
